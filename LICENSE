This repository contains code that was taken from the Stellar Laboratory <https://github.com/stellar/laboratory>.

Part of the original code was licensed under Apache 2.0, but recent additions haven't yet been
made available under an open source license. We're waiting for the Stellar Development Foundation
to make a decision on licensing these files for reuse.

Until this matter is resolved, this program should be considered to be for experimental use only.
DO NOT include any part of it in your own project, unless you have received permission to do so
from all copyright holders.
